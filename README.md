This is the main Fortran code that I generated for one of my dissertation chapters, "A Dynamic Adoption Model with Bayesian Learning: An Application to U.S. Soybean Farmers", which was published in Agricultural Economics in 2014 (DOI: 10.1111/agec.12124).

Environment:
1. Fortran 90, compiled by Intel ifort on a Linux work station
2. IDE: Vim
